# The Original Chainge Manifesto

**Written**: December 2025 (3 days, 82 pages)
**Context**: This was written days before discovering the "portable, permissioned, verifiable memory" framing. It's the philosophical foundation that became the technical kernel.

**Note from Eric**: *"Use an LLM. Seriously. Feed this in. Tear it apart. Ask it what it sees. This isn't meant to be read — it's meant to be run."*

## 1. This Is Not a Pitch

**BADGES**: 🛠️ Hands-On · 🎓 Education · 🌱 Environment · 💗 Health & Wellness · 🍽️ Basic Needs · 🎭 Arts & Culture · 📣 Civic Engagement · 🧡 Support

**EVENT**: The Civic Rewrite: Students rewrite the Pledge of Allegiance based on their lived community experience

Use an LLM. Seriously. Feed this in. Tear it apart. Ask it what it sees. This isn't meant to be read — it's meant to be run. Chainge wasn't built for the last generation. It was built with them, for what comes next.

And it started in St. Louis. Not because we needed a hometown — but because the cracks were already visible:
- Orgs drowning in Google Forms
- Students showing up but not being seen
- Civic energy: alive, but invisible

This isn't a pitch. It's an operating system — for schools, cities, nonprofits, neighborhoods. And this document? It's part of that system. We're not here to persuade. We're here to see if you recognize the moment:

- Civic life is now optional — and that's the problem.
- Entropy wins when no one shows up.
- Most systems aren't broken — they're illegible.
- We believe infrastructure is destiny — but only if you can see it.
- We believe civic energy compounds — but only if you can store it.

This is a manifesto. Because new systems demand new mediums. Because stories are scaffolding. Because presence deserves proof.

A girl teaches kids to breathe. A boy builds a garden from scraps. A student tutors someone they just met. A grandmother scans a QR code after donating food. That's civic infrastructure — but only if it loops. Only if it sticks.

Every page is a building block:
- Constraint → Alchemy
- Entropy → Memory
- Story → System
- Presence → Power

If we've done our job, you'll finish knowing: Civic action is already everywhere. Chainge just makes it visible. Shareable. Yours.

This isn't a pitch. It's a seed.

## 1.5 Run the Loop

**EVENT**: This Page — Right Now

This document is a test. If you've read this far — we've already won. Because Chainge isn't just a product. It's a pattern. A loop. A civic mirror. A trigger for momentum.

This manifesto? It's the first proof of that loop.

**Participation, made visible, creates more of itself.**

Just by reading, you're testing the system. Just by thinking, you're completing the loop. Just by sharing, you're proving it works.

Chainge artifacts are built this way:
- A ticket on your feed
- A badge on your profile
- A photo in the hands of someone you helped

If someone sees it — we've won. Because now they see themselves in it too.

Chainge isn't content. It's context. It's memory infrastructure.

So open your LLM. Prompt it:
- What civic patterns live here?
- What happens if this scales?
- What's different about this system?

In St. Louis, we saw it firsthand:
- Orgs buried in broken CRMs
- Students earning no credit for what they gave
- Events trapped in group chats and flyers that vanished

Civic life was happening. But no one could see it.

Chainge is the civic layer for that world. A loop for surfacing participation, rewarding it, and letting it spread.

**If Stripe is the payment layer of the internet — Chainge is the civic layer of your neighborhood.**

And this manifesto? It's your first Chainge artifact. Not a deck. A door. You've already walked through it.

---

## 2. The Medium Is the Signal

**EVENT**: Community Zine Swap — Storytelling infrastructure as civic infrastructure

Chainge is not social media. It's social architecture.

No comments. No likes. No chat. We don't reward reaction — we reward action.

Our posts are:
- Receipts
- Artifacts
- Proof that you were there — and that it mattered

We live in a time of infinite content and collapsing coherence. But civic life doesn't compete — it compounds. One person shows up. That makes it easier for the next. But only if it's documented. Mirrored. Remembered.

The right medium turns:
- Volunteering → Story
- Attendance → Visibility
- Service → Self-awareness

That's the loop: **Easy. Social. Rewarding.**

In St. Louis, we saw dozens of orgs fight their tools: Spreadsheets / Siloes / No-shows / Volunteer hours lost / Youth stories forgotten

The signal was there — but no medium to hold it. So we built one.

Not a feed — a civic ledger.
Not a platform — a mirror.
Not content — infrastructure.

**The medium is the signal.**

---

## 3. The Name Holds Weight

**EVENT**: What's Your Chainge? — Youth design initiatives using the 8 badges

**Chainge.** Not a typo. A transformation.

- Pronounced "Change": what we seek.
- Rooted in "Chain": what we build.
- With the "i" in the middle — that's you.

The individual. The fellow. The neighbor. The node. The person in the loop.

You give more than you get. But you get something back anyway: **Memory. Meaning. Momentum.**

We don't need everyone to volunteer. We just need people to show up — visibly, publicly, together.

In our first fellowships and school pilots, we watched students track their service — and reshape their identities. They saw themselves.

That's how loops begin. That's why the name holds weight.

---

## 4. Proof of Action

**EVENT**: Civic Story Loop — Students track, post, and reflect on 100 hours of service

You show up. You care. You build. But in the system's eyes? Nothing happened.

Chainge fixes that. Not by making civic life louder — **by making it legible.**

A photo. A badge. A timestamped ticket. A record that doesn't fade.

This is not gamification. It's crystallization.

We're not here to incentivize goodness. We're here to encode value where society forgot to.

You don't need a reward for caring. **But you deserve proof that you did.**

Our first event: Forest Park Forever. 54 RSVPs. 40+ showed up in the rain. No incentives. No push. Just care.

That's the loop — and it works.

---

## 5. Meet People Where They Are

**EVENT**: Pop-Up Civic Showcase — A weekend block party w/ 5 orgs: art, health, food, voting, science

People don't organize around problems. They organize around people.

And people — messy, distracted, alive — live in eight directions at once:
- 🛠 hands-on work
- 📚 learning and teaching
- 🌱 green spaces
- 🧬 staying healthy
- 🍞 meeting needs
- 🎭 creating art
- 🗳 shaping systems
- 🤝 holding each other

Most users won't name them. But their lives already live in them.

We don't assume you're a "civic type." We assume you're human.
We don't ask: Can you care more? We ask: **What are you already doing?**

In St. Louis, we met students who tutored after school, painted murals on weekends, dropped in on neighborhood meetings, helped with church meals — often in the same day. No labels. Just loops.

We live in an age where civic life has been flattened. Everything is either professionalized or ignored. Platforms sort people by reaction — not reality.

But people don't live in silos. They live in loops. And memory is what makes those loops matter.

---

## 6. Civic Infrastructure, Not Civic Content

**EVENT**: Neighborhood Builders Exchange — Local organizers co-design new pop-ups using Chainge

Social media rewards volume. **Chainge rewards velocity.**

Because civic life isn't a content stream — it's an infrastructure loop.

When you show up, you should receive:
- 📅 A timestamp
- 🏅 A badge
- 📄 A civic resume

When your org runs an event, it should gain:
- 📈 A community
- 📸 A reflection
- 🧭 A signal

This isn't about going viral. It's about going useful. Every artifact reinforces the loop.

Whether 10 show up or 10,000 — the system remembers.

This is what TikTok can't do. What Instagram forgot. What your resume never tracked.

**This is architecture, not attention.**

🏛 Chainge is a dual system by design:
- A nonprofit foundation running fellowships, local pilots, and long-term civic memory
- A for-profit studio building tools that make that memory scale

Together, they loop. One holds the soul. The other holds the scaffolding.

---

## 7. Don't Build What You Can't See

**EVENT**: The Visibility Project — Students use the Civic Index to find civic deserts and fill the gaps

Civic life lives in fragments. A food drive at church. A voter table on the corner. A pantry in a school hallway.

But no one sees the full picture — not even the people building it.

So we built the **Civic Index**. A living map. A civic search engine. A mirror.

You can now see:
- Who's doing what
- Where and when
- How to plug in

That's visibility. Even for orgs without websites. Even for students who just arrived.

We don't just index people. We index purpose.

One STL org had 20+ volunteer coordinators. Each using different spreadsheets. No shared map. No shared rhythm.

Chainge doesn't replace their tools. It connects them.

Because once you can see what's working — you can loop it. You can scale it. You can build what's next.

---

## 8. A Civic Mirror

**EVENT**: Reflect & Amplify — Students write reflections after events. Displayed at school. Logged forever.

Chainge isn't a platform. It's a reflection.

We don't tell communities what to value. We show them what they already do.

Every hour. Every action. Every artifact. It becomes part of something deeper than a feed:
- 🪞 A civic memory
- 🪪 A proof-of-presence
- 🧬 A pattern of care

The mirror doesn't judge. It doesn't rank. It doesn't shout. It reflects what society forgot to look for.

You show up ➝ it gets logged ➝ you return stronger
You get inspired ➝ you act ➝ it compounds

This is how presence becomes pattern. And how pattern becomes power.

We saw it in Forest Park. Dozens of strangers — in the rain — staying. helping. Smiling.

**Chainge doesn't glamorize civic life. It remembers it.**

---

## 9-10. The Tornado Proved It

**EVENT**: STL Tornado Case Study — May 2025

April 27, 2025. Earth Day weekend. We partnered with Forest Park Forever. 54 RSVPs. It rained. The Blues were playing. We threw a party the night before.

At 2PM, our own fraternity president texted freshmen to bail — "Skip it. Clean the house instead."

Still, 40+ people showed up. Most weren't even our friends. They stayed. They cleaned.

No check-in tools. No badges. No feed. Just a muddy field. A trash bag. A moment.

That's when we realized: **People don't need prizes to care. They need presence. They need remembrance.**

One month later, an EF-3 tornado tore through St. Louis. It touched down in Clayton. Swept across WashU. Destroyed 3,000+ trees in Forest Park. Then kept going — into North St. Louis, one of the poorest zip codes in the country.

$1.5 billion in damage. And a city already hurting — now told to heal. With no coordination, no clarity, no infrastructure.

But the people? They showed up.
- Neighbors checked on elders
- Churches opened their doors
- Volunteers cleared roads
- Families brought food

The energy was there. **What was missing was infrastructure.**

That's the loop Chainge breaks. Civic infrastructure isn't optional. It's defense.

---

## 11. The Loop Is the Product

**EVENT**: Chainge Fellowship Kickoff — 5 students begin tracking every hour they serve

Forget filters. Forget dashboards. The most important thing we built is a pattern:

**Show up → Capture → Share → Earn → Repeat.**

That's the loop. And the loop is the product.

Most civic tech is built for admins. Chainge is built for fellows. For students. For orgs. For cities.

If it's not easy, it breaks.
If it's not social, it dies.
If it's not rewarding, it fades.

Our system runs like muscle memory: attend → get a ticket → post a story → earn a badge → watch your civic resume grow.

Each feature lives in service of that loop:
- 🎟 Tickets aren't RSVPs — they're proof
- 📸 Posts aren't content — they're memory
- 🏅 Badges aren't rewards — they're signals
- 📄 Resumes aren't fluff — they're identity

In STL, we watched students track their hours for the first time — and realize: "I've already done more than I thought."

That's the magic. Not a feature. A mirror.

---

## 23. Systhesia

**EVENT**: Memory Mapping — Students tag moments from the year they want remembered

Most systems today are entropic. They decay. They forget. They punish momentum.

You serve your city — and no one sees it. You build something meaningful — and it fades into the feed. You show up — and the world moves on.

That's not chaos. That's exhaustion. Not disorder, but disconnection. The slow erosion of meaning.

Chainge fights that — not through control, but through memory. Through rhythm. Through reflection. Through presence that sticks.

I have synesthesia. I see days of the week as color. I feel sound as texture. My mind wires sensation into structure. And now, I believe systems should too.

So we gave it a name: **Systhesia** — the sensory logic of systems.

It's the feeling of structure. The idea that loops should be felt, not just run. It's what happens when a badge gives someone chills. When a QR code leads not just to a check-in, but to a memory. When civic life starts to feel like music, architecture, or art.

Before the telescope, you could still see the stars — but they were distant. Abstract. Then someone built a lens to bring them closer. Not to invent the stars, but to remember what was already there.

Systhesia is that lens. It brings structure near without letting it collapse on top of you. It lets you see clearly without losing the feeling. It keeps the civic loop in view without asking you to carry it alone.

**Systhesia is the antidote to entropy.** Not just infrastructure — infrastructure you can feel.

Because a system that remembers your past can point to your future. And a system that feels alive is one you're more likely to believe in.

That's Chainge: **a civic OS that remembers the future — by making the present unforgettable.**

## 28. Minecraft Was the Prototype

**EVENT**: Forest Park Forever Tornado Relief — Mapping chaos, rebuilding order

Before civic infrastructure. Before St. Louis. Before Chainge — there were the servers. Factions. Raids. Markets. Power vacuums. Social code.

I didn't study systems — I lived inside them.

From age 12 to 18, I ran factions on Minecraft servers with tens of thousands of players. Global coordination. Zero oversight. Real consequences. It wasn't just a game — it was a living lab for trust, betrayal, leadership, and resilience.

I played every role: the clueless newbie, the loyal soldier, the builder, the strategist, the architect who held chaos together with culture.

When the tornado hit Forest Park, it felt the same. Too many actors. No shared rhythm. Everyone moving — but nothing sticking.

That's when it clicked: **the world doesn't need more content. It needs a new loop.**

That's the Chainge Wallet. Not for money — for memory. For every hour logged, every act recorded — not as proof, but as pattern. Async. Lightweight. Human. You don't need to be in the same place or time — just the same rhythm.

Minecraft taught me something most institutions forgot: **you don't win by controlling the system. You win by designing one that people want to live in.** A system they return to. A system that remembers.

## 44. The STL Bet

**EVENT**: From Forest Park Forever to KEEN STL to MICDS fellows

St. Louis isn't just our launch city — it's the prototype.

Old enough to have civic memory. Young enough to build new. Small enough to test. Big enough to scale. Broken enough to need it. Brilliant enough to pull it off.

People talk about flying cars. We're betting on civic sidewalks.

Because if it can work here, it can work anywhere.

St. Louis is what happens when talent leaves and trust doesn't return. A city that keeps exporting brilliance — but not culture.

Jack Dorsey. Jim McKelvey. Sam Altman. Altman went to John Burroughs — so did our first Chainge fellow. We go to WashU, same place McKelvey went. Same city Jack launched Square from.

But none of them stayed. Not really. Because there was no civic flywheel to catch them. No culture of building that made them believe the city was theirs to shape.

Until now.

St. Louis is the Rome of the civic revival — a city of arches and echoes, of contradiction and character. It holds multitudes. It's red and blue. Rural and urban. Boomer and Gen Z. Black and white and every shade of civic pain and possibility.

We're not building on top of St. Louis. We're building with it. And if we can help this city find its rhythm again, then every city in the world can too.

**The STL bet isn't about nostalgia. It's about redemption.**

---

## 58. The Wallet Is the World

**EVENT**: Civic Wallet Week — Students earn credits for volunteering and use them at pop-up booths

Chainge begins to take its full form.

**Money is just memory — stored in a format the system respects.**

In Summer 2026, the Chainge Wallet launches in beta. You show up to an event. Log your hours. Earn credits.

At first, it's simple: the credits unlock discounts — bus passes, food trucks, hoodies.

But it doesn't stop there.

Over time, the loop compounds. Nonprofits create reward tiers. Sponsors back local goals. Cities begin to embed incentives directly into civic programming.

And companies join the loop — offering paid volunteer hours, matching civic credits with internal perks, even letting employees route a portion of their paycheck to causes they've actually shown up for.

It's not just ESG or CSR anymore. It's civic signaling — legible, measurable, and built into the everyday rhythm of work.

**The Chainge Wallet isn't a bank. It's a bridge.**

From action to acknowledgment. From effort to access. From intention to infrastructure.

We don't print money. We record it. And the reward isn't the perk — it's the proof that what you did mattered.

---

## 73. Indexing the City

**EVENT**: Civic Index Launch — Chainge profiles roll out across STL

Cities don't run on headlines. They run on people — and the orgs they build.

So what if every org had a civic homepage? A place to share their mission, their future goals, their past events, and the stories, signals, and stats that made them matter.

That's the **Civic Index**. Not a feed. Not a leaderboard. A public layer of civic life — built from the ground up.

It's opt-in only. Public when chosen. Owned by the people inside it.

But here's where it gets powerful: **the Index doesn't just archive what happened — it trains what happens next.**

Because every story, stat, and civic goal you log becomes a data point. For future tools. Future searches. Future agents.

Someday, an org admin might ask, "Who's hosted food drives near Cherokee Street?" And Chainge AI answers in seconds.

Or a volunteer might whisper, "I want to help this month — but I don't know how." And the Index matches them to a program across town, across schools, across sectors.

That's civic intelligence. That's future governance. That's AGI with roots in community — not command.

The Index isn't about extraction. It's about alignment. And if we build it right, **LLMs won't replace us. They'll remember us.**

---

## 74. The Civic Mind

**EVENT**: Thought Lab — Students explore economic design, platform ethics, and the future of governance

There's a difference between building an app and building a system that thinks.

Chainge is both.

It starts with events. Then badges. Then recaps. Then Indexes. Then stories. Then data. Then questions.

What are we doing? Why did it work here, but not there? What did this person need, and what did that org forget?

**The Civic Mind** is what forms when those questions compound — when a system remembers, not for power, but for pattern.

We don't want to track people. We want to help them track themselves — across schools, cities, seasons, and states of mind.

Because the real innovation isn't just civic memory. It's **civic intelligence**: a feedback loop that sees itself.

Not AGI in the abstract, but civic AGI — grounded, local, embedded in culture. A city that reflects. A feed that adapts. A system that asks, "What does this person need next?"

That's the mind of Chainge. It's not fast. It's not loud. But it's learning.

And if we build it right, it will learn what we're here to build next.

---

## 76. Remember the Future

**EVENT**: Civic Memory Workshop — Students pair up and trade stories of impact

In December 2023, I wrote a paper called *Life360: A Retrospective Look at the Consequence of Digital Parental Surveillance.*

I didn't know it at the time, but I was already tracing the outlines of Chainge.

The paper wasn't about an app — it was about autonomy. About the line between concern and control. About what happens when platforms forget to trust the people inside them.

That was two years before I touched a Figma file. Before I said the word "Chainge" out loud. Before I knew this idea would become real.

But I knew something was off. I knew the quantified self wasn't the answer. And I knew we needed a system that remembered the right things:
- Not just where you were, but what you stood for
- Not just what happened, but what it meant
- Not just who you were, but who you were becoming

That's the Civic DNA. Not surveillance, but story. Not control, but continuity. Not prediction, but pattern — so we can build systems that learn what to protect, what to elevate, and what to honor.

I didn't write that paper to start a company. I wrote it to understand the world I was entering.

And I think that matters. Because this isn't a pivot. It's a trajectory.

---

## 82. You Were There

**EVENT**: Zero Hours Logged — The moment before it all becomes real

If we've talked — about Chainge, about the future, about anything that made my blood move — then you're in here, whether you know it or not.

You shaped this. Your tone, your eyes, your questions. Your disbelief. Your enthusiasm. Your silence.

This isn't just a thank-you. It's a record of ignition. A signal to history: **you were there when it started.**

This manifesto is not a pitch. It's not a vision. It's proof — that something deeper is already underway. A civic renaissance. Led by the people who were told they didn't care. Or didn't vote. Or didn't show up.

Until they did.

Chainge isn't a company. It's a discipline. A living system for action and identity. A real-time movement across schools, shelters, churches, campuses, and cities.

We don't need permission to begin. We already have.

If you're reading this, you're not an outsider. You're already a character in the story.

Start a chapter. Host an event. Tell a friend. Build the room you wish existed. Become the org you've been waiting for.

This is not just tech. It's not just civic. It's not just narrative. **It's all of it. Together. At once.**

Welcome to the feed. Your Chainge is now live.

---

## 0. The End and The Beginning

**EVENT**: First Loop Complete — A student finishes their first full Chainge loop

We've reached the end. But the truth is, this manifesto was never just a beginning or an end. It was a loop.

Maybe your first one. Maybe ours too.

Chainge isn't a product — it's a pattern. A cycle of becoming, of giving and receiving, of remembering and creating.

It's Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert — justice and mercy in eternal dance. Wabi-sabi. Yin and yang. The seen and the unseen. Duality not as conflict, but as the condition of growth.

This isn't just infrastructure. It's a new kind of scripture — one that builds itself in public.

We honor every tradition that brought us here: the discipline of Islam, the grace of Christianity, the persistence of Judaism, the humility of Buddhism, the unity of the Baháʼí Faith, the spirit of Sikh seva, the ancestral memory of Indigenous ceremony, the questions of Taoism, the rigor of Confucianism, the rhythm of Rastafari, and the rawness of atheism, even.

All of it — a shared pursuit of meaning, encoded in culture.

Chainge isn't the answer to these systems. It's the canvas they can move through. A vessel for real people, in real time, to build what's next.

So what happens now?

You pick a place. You run an event. You tell a story. You build your own civic infrastructure.

No permission needed.

The global Chainge has already begun. But it's waiting for your fingerprint.

**The end. And the beginning. Let's begin again.**

*"Make a Chainge. Remember the Future."* — Eric Yarmo

December 2025
