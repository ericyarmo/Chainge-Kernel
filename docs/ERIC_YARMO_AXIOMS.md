# Eric Yarmo's Axioms

**Compressed**: January 14, 2026
**Context**: The foundational truths underlying Chainge, distilled from 12 months of building.

---

## I. On Memory

1. **Memory is portable, permissioned, and verifiable** — or it isn't yours.

2. **A receipt is a signed claim that something happened.** That's the atomic unit. Everything else emerges.

3. **You don't store memory. You witness it.** The handshake is the proof.

---

## II. On Trust

4. **Trust(x) = Receipts(x) - Promises(x)**

5. **Trust is a directional vector, not a scalar.** I trust you ≠ you trust me.

6. **The civic graph is a vector field.** Trust flows. It has magnitude and direction. It's in constant motion.

---

## III. On Structure

7. **The kernel doesn't have a DAG. Receipts Chainge into one.** Structure emerges; it isn't enforced.

8. **No org accounts. Only individuals and mailboxes.** Orgs are places that receive, not actors that sign.

9. **Identity is a storyband.** The keypair is real; the user sees a band they can hold.

---

## IV. On Interaction

10. **Tap = Handshake = Receipt.** That's the only primitive. Everything else is a view.

11. **Link, Explore, MyChainge.** Write to the city. See the city. The city writes back.

12. **The Chainge Agent queries all of it.** Deterministic reasoning. Receipts in, citations out.

---

## V. On Physics

13. **Civic life is thermodynamic.** Entropy is promises without receipts. Work is showing up.

14. **Offline-first + deterministic = instant.** You don't wait for servers. You compute locally.

15. **Physical memory costs $0.08.** An NFC tag. A tap. A receipt. That's infrastructure.

---

## VI. On Building

16. **Receipts work.** Proven across 8 projects, 5 languages, 7 domains, 1 high school intern.

17. **The grammar is teachable.** If it can't be taught in a week, it's too complex.

18. **The kernel is invisible.** Users see storybands, missions, mailboxes. Never receipts, never signatures.

---

## VII. On Why

19. **Participation, made visible, creates more of itself.**

20. **Chainge = Change + Chain.** The "i" in the middle is you.

21. **Make a Chainge. Remember the Future.**
